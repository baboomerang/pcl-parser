/**
 * <b>Command ESC * r # F</b>
 * The Raster Graphics Presentation command specifies the orientation
 * of the raster image on the logical page.
 *
 * <b>Default</b> = 3
 * <b>Range</b> = 0, 3
 * 
 * 	# =0 - Raster image prints in orientation of logical page
 * 		3 - Raster image prints along the width of the physical page
 *
 * <b>Notes</b>
 * A value of 0 indicates that a raster row ï¿½will be printed in the positive
 * X-direction of the PCL coordinate system. (The print direction
 * translates the PCL coordinate system.)
 * A value of 3 indicates that the raster graphics will be printed along
 * the width of the physical page, regardless of logical page orientation.
 * In portrait orientation, a raster row is printed in the positive X-direction
 * of the PCL coordinate system and a subsequent raster row is printed
 * beginning at the next dot row position in the positive Y-direction.
 * In landscape orientation, a raster row is printed in the positive
 * Y-direction of the PCL coordinate system and a subsequent raster
 * row is printed beginning at the next dot row position in the negative
 * X-direction.
